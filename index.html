    Hello! My name is Dianna Harutyunyan and I am from Armenia.
    I have studied Law in the UK, and I enjoy learning new things in life.
    Software and development is my new passion. I am excited to be part of this class
    and look forward to learning more about web and software development.
    Previously, I have done a Data Analytics course and enjoyed it.
    In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading books, and spending quality time with my family.
